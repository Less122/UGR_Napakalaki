# NAPAKALAKI

Napakalaki is a ... based card game designed by my PDOO profesors at the University of Granada that Juan Jose Martín and I programmed as part of the subject practices.  

The game is programmed in both Java and Ruby and the GUI is made with swing in the Java version. The implementation was made using the NedBeans 8.1 editor.

## Development
This project is still in development and a final installable version isn't availible yet.
