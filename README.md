# NAPAKALAKI

Napakalaki is a Munchkin based card game designed by my PDOO profesors at the University of Granada that Juan Jose Martín and I programmed as part of the subject practices.  

The game is programmed in both Java and Ruby and the GUI is made with swing in the Java version. The implementation was made using the NedBeans 8.1 editor.

## About the Game
In the game 3 players try to get level 10 before the rest. Everyone starts with level 1 and climb up to level 10. The game consist on fighting monsters using a series of card weapons called treasures.   
Every player has a randomly assigned enemy and can steal from him under certain conditions.   
Winning a fight against a monster gets you a price that can be either levels, treasures or both of them, and losing a fight gives you a bad consequence you need to redeem before the next turn.

## Development
This project is still in development and a final installable version isn't availible yet.
